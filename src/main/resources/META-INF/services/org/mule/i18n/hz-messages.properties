#Each message should be given a unique numerical id i.e.
#
#1=This is a test message with a single argument {0}
#
#Arguments can be placed in the message using {0}, {1}, etc placeholders
#
#To get a message listed here use the following -
# new Message("Hz", "<message id>" [, <arg 1>, <arg 2>]);
#
# "Hz" is the protocol of this transport
# <message id> is the id of the message in this file
# <arg x> is a list of String arguments to pass to the message
